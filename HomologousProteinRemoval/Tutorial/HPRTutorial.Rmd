```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


<br>

Before starting, remember to run all the code in the HPRFunctions.R file. This will make all the Homologous Protein Removal functions available to you in R.

<br>

## Data Format

In your dataset, Below is a screenshot of part of a dataset that includes all these criteria:

<br>

### Genus Binner Function Library

In this section, for each Genus Binner function, I will list all possible arguments and possible values of the arguments including the argument's default.

<br>

Because R does not read spaces between arguments, rather than write the functions on a single line as we have done so far, like this:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(x)
```


I will expand the function across multiple lines and comment the arguments like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(
    x    #the numbers to find the mean of
    )
```

#### Homologous Protein Removal Functions:


#### HPR()

```{r , eval = FALSE}
HPR(
    data,                    #data as described at top of this document
    procol,                  #column number with the protein names (default = none)
    grocol,                  #column number to group the proteins by (default = none)
    pattern = "OS="          #pattern to locate the genus by (default = "OS=")

)
```

data, procol, grocol, pattern = "OS="
